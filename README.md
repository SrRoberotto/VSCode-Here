# VSCode-Here
This regedit file installs the command "VSCode Here" on Windows Explorer folder context menus, opening the entire folder on VSCode.

It works like the "code ." or "code <folder>" on shell.

Works on Windows 10, but can be adapted to olders.

Make sure that instalation path is the same in the reg file or modify it acording prior to install

Default installation path is: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe", just change it on reg file, save and apply.
